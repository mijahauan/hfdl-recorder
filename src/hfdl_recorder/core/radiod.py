"""Thin wrapper around ka9q-python ``RadiodControl.ensure_channel`` for HFDL.

Per CLIENT-CONTRACT.md §7, clients never pass ``destination=`` — radiod
+ ka9q-python deterministically derive the multicast group. We read the
resolved address back from ``ChannelInfo`` for inventory purposes.

The radiod HFDL fragment ships every band as ``mode=iq`` ``encoding=s16be``
with band-specific ``samprate``. We hard-code those here so the band
table in :mod:`hfdl_recorder.bands` stays purely descriptive.

HFDL_PRESET = "iq"
# ka9q.Encoding.F32LE = 4. radiod can serve any encoding the operator
# requests; the constraint here is that ka9q-python's IQ payload parser
# (ka9q/stream.py::_parse_payload, the ``if is_iq:`` branch) hard-codes
# np.float32 LE and does not honour the ``encoding`` parameter for IQ
# channels. Asking for s16be IQ delivers raw big-endian bytes that
# numpy reinterprets as float32 garbage (NaN, denormals, ±FLT_MAX).
# Asking for F32LE matches ka9q-python's parser, so the on_samples
# callback gets the clean unit-scaled IQ we need. Different
# (freq, sample_rate, encoding) tuples produce different SSRCs, so
# the s16be channels declared by the radiod HFDL fragment stay idle
# and don't conflict with the F32LE ones we create on demand.
